To solve this problem using window functions, you can follow these steps:

1. **Filter the data for the relevant dates**: We need to get the exchange rates for January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020.
2. **Use a window function to calculate the difference**: We can use the `LAG` or `LEAD` function to get the exchange rate on January 1, 2020, and then calculate the difference with the exchange rate on July 1, 2020.

Hereâ€™s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
WITH exchange_rates AS (
    SELECT
        source_currency,
        exchange_rate,
        date,
        -- Use LAG to get the exchange rate on January 1, 2020
        LAG(exchange_rate) OVER (PARTITION BY source_currency ORDER BY date) AS jan_rate
    FROM
        sf_exchange_rate
    WHERE
        date IN ('2020-01-01', '2020-07-01')
)
SELECT
    source_currency AS currency_code,
    exchange_rate - jan_rate AS rate_difference
FROM
    exchange_rates
WHERE
    date = '2020-07-01';
```

### Explanation:

1. **Filtering the Data**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the data to only include exchange rates on January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020.

2. **Window Function**:
   - The `LAG` function is used to get the exchange rate on January 1, 2020, for each currency. The `PARTITION BY source_currency` ensures that the calculation is done separately for each currency, and `ORDER BY date` ensures that the previous value (January 1, 2020) is correctly aligned with the current value (July 1, 2020).

3. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - In the final `SELECT` statement, we calculate the difference between the exchange rate on July 1, 2020, and the exchange rate on January 1, 2020.

4. **Final Filter**:
   - The final `WHERE` clause ensures that we only output the results for July 1, 2020, which contains the difference we are interested in.

### Output:
The output will be a list of currency codes and the difference in their exchange rates between July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2020.

### Example Output:
| currency_code | rate_difference |
|---------------|-----------------|
| EUR           | 0.05            |
| GBP           | -0.02           |
| JPY           | 0.10            |

This output shows how the exchange rate of each currency changed between January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020.
